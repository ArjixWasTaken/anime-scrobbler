# :penguin: :snake: Anime Scrobbler (_for research purposes of course_) :snake: :penguin:

Just an automation utility/hobby project for fun, ~~potentially useless?~~  to download missing shows from 
your [AniList](https://anilist.co) collection not present in a plex media server.


**How does it work?**

This little app consists of **5** modules:

- anilist
    > Handles requests to anilist to fetch your list/s
- app
    > Central point of the application, handles calls to other modules, database operations, utilities, e.t.c.
- nyaa
    > Queries nyaa.si for torrents matching shows missing in your plex media server but available 
    > in one or more of your lists and any shows in a given list name at run time. (see `How do I use it?`)
- plex
    > Handles searching and matching anilist meida agains plex library shows. This module 
    > will use `romaji`, `english` and `synonyms` from anilist when searching in 
    > plex until a match is found, and each result is tested for a **98%** match 
    > (this avoids false negatives given shows in plex may slightly differ from anilist names). 
- transmission
    > Handles dispatching torrents to `Transmission` for downloading

**Q:** _What versin of python is required?_ <br/>
**A:** _Python 3.7+ because the application uses `@dataclass` annotations_


**Q:** _What about python 2?_ <br/>
**A:** _:laughing: that's funny_


**Q:** _Where are the unit tests?_ <br/>
**A:** _I didn't have time :hankey:_


**Q:** _What if I don't have transmission?_ <br/>
**A:** _The torrent files will be downloaded in a local directory labled torrents `./app/torrents`_


**Q:** _Are there any limitations?_ <br/>
**A:** Yes!! ofcourse :smiling_imp: :bug:
- _Sometimes `plexapi` returns 0 results for a search query, desipite the search term being 100% exact (not sure why this happens)
  and because of this the application will assume this item doesn't exist in your plex library and add it to the list of missing shows_
- _Due to how Plex presents it's shows as seasons and AniList represents media as individual items and nyaa has a lot of variation, I    can't guarantee that shows will be found or matched correctly._
- _More??? You tell me__ 


**How do I use it?**

> Before we get started I will assume that you have some basic knowledge regarding `python` and `pip`
> **Tip:** Google is your friend :wink:

- Create your configuration files in `.app/config/` 
- Create your authentication files in `.app/auth/`
- Install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) and set it up
- Install the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`


> You can find **configuration** instructions [here](https://github.com/wax911/anime-scrobbler/tree/develop/app/config) and **authentication** instructions [here](https://github.com/wax911/anime-scrobbler/tree/develop/app/auth)

The application is CLI based and you can expose the available commands through:

```sh
python manage.py --help
```

> **N.B** if you're not running python

}
```

### [TinyDB](https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb)

> TinyDB is a lightweight document oriented database optimized for your happiness :) 
It's written in pure Python and has no external dependencies. The target are small apps 
that would be blown away by a SQL-DB or an external database server.

#### Example Code

```python
from tinydb import TinyDB
db = TinyDB('/path/to/db.json')
db.insert({'int': 1, 'char': 'a'})
db.insert({'int': 1, 'char': 'b'})
```

__Query Language__

```python
from tinydb import TinyDB, Query

User = Query()
db = TinyDB('/path/to/db.json')
# Search for a field value
db.search(User.name == 'John')
[{'name': 'John', 'age': 22}, {'name': 'John', 'age': 37}]

# Combine two queries with logical and
db.search((User.name == 'John') & (User.age <= 30))
[{'name': 'John', 'age': 22}]

# Combine two queries with logical or
db.search((User.name == 'John') | (User.name == 'Bob'))
[{'name': 'John', 'age': 22}, {'name': 'John', 'age': 37}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 42}]

# More possible comparisons:  !=  <  >  <=  >=
# More possible checks: where(...).matches(regex), where(...).test(your_test_func)
```

__Tables__

```python
table = db.table('name')
table.insert({'value': True})
table.all()
[{'value': True}]
```

### [Plex API](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi)

> There are two types of authentication. If you are running on a separate 
network or using Plex Users you can log into MyPlex to get a PlexServer instance. 
An example of this is below. NOTE: Servername below is the name of the server 
(not the hostname and port). 
If logged into Plex Web you can see the server name in the top left above your available libraries.

```python
from plexapi.myplex import MyPlexAccount

account = MyPlexAccount('<USERNAME>', '<PASSWORD>')  
# returns a PlexServer instance
plex = account.resource('<SERVERNAME>').connect()
```
> If you want to avoid logging into MyPlex and you already know your auth token string, 
you can use the PlexServer object directly as above, but passing in the baseurl and auth token directly.

```python
from plexapi.server import PlexServer

baseurl = 'http://plexserver:32400'
token = '2ffLuB84dqLswk9skLos'
plex = PlexServer(baseurl, token)
```

> [Usage examples](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi)

### [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql-python/gql)

> The example below shows how you can execute queries against a local schema.

```python
from gql import gql, Client

client = Client(schema=schema)
query = gql('''
{
  hello
}
''')

client.execute(query)
```

### [Dacite](https://github.com/konradhalas/dacite)

> This module simplifies creation of data classes ([PEP 557][pep-557])
from dictionaries.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dacite import from_dict


@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    age: int
    is_active: bool


data = {
    'name': 'john',
    'age': 30,
    'is_active': True,
}

user = from_dict(data_class=User, data=data)

assert user == User(name='john', age=30, is_active=True)
```

### [anitopy](https://github.com/igorcmoura/anitopy)

> Anitopy is a Python library for parsing anime video filenames. It's simple to use and it's based on the C++ library `Anitomy <https://github.com/erengy/anitomy>`_.

```python
import anitopy
anitopy.parse('[TaigaSubs]_Toradora!_(2008)_-_01v2_-_Tiger_and_Dragon_[1280x720_H.264_FLAC][1234ABCD].mkv')
```

> Will result in the following:
```json
{
   "anime_title": "Toradora!",
   "anime_year": "2008",
   "audio_term": "FLAC",
   "episode_number": "01",
   "episode_title": "Tiger and Dragon",
   "file_checksum": "1234ABCD",
   "file_extension": "mkv",
   "file_name": "[TaigaSubs]_Toradora!_(2008)_-_01v2_-_Tiger_and_Dragon_[1280x720_H.264_FLAC][1234ABCD].mkv",
   "release_group": "TaigaSubs",
   "release_version": "2",
   "video_resolution": "1280x720",
   "video_term": "H.264"
}
```

### [Transmission Clutch](https://pypi.org/project/transmission-clutch/)

> `clutch` was designed to be a more lightweight and consistent [Transmission][transmission]
RPC library than what was currently available for [Python][python]. Instead of simply
using the keys/fields in the [Transmission RPC spec][transmission-rpc] which have a mix of
dashed separated words and mixed case words, `clutch` tries to convert all
keys to be more Pythonic: underscore separated words. This conversion is
done so that it is still possible to specify the fields/argument specified in the [Transmission RPC spec][transmission-rpc], but if you do so your mileage may vary *(probably want to
avoid it)*.


To install:

```sh
pip install transmission-clutch
```

To use:

```
>>> from clutch.core import Client
```

### [Unidecode](https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode/)

> The module exports a function that takes an Unicode object (Python 2.x) or string (Python 3.x) and returns a string (that can be encoded to ASCII bytes in Python 3.x):

```python
from unidecode import unidecode
unidecode(u'ko\u017eu\u0161\u010dek')
# outputs > 'kozuscek'
unidecode(u'30 \U0001d5c4\U0001d5c6/\U0001d5c1')
# outputs > '30 km/h'
unidecode(u"\u5317\u4EB0")
# outputs > 'Bei Jing '
```
